        <p className="text-gr4 md:text-gr3 overflow-y-auto p-2">
          The golden ratio, often denoted by the Greek letter phi (Ï†), is a mathematical
          concept that represents a special ratio found in nature, art, and design. It&apos;s
          approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. In design and aesthetics, the golden ratio
          is believed to create aesthetically pleasing proportions. When applied to typography,
          it helps determine font sizes that appear visually balanced and harmonious to the
          human eye.
